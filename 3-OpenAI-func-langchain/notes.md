# OpenAI function calling in LangChainJS

Now we can combine the OpenAI function calling we saw in lesson 1 with Lang chain.

## ~~Pydantic~~ Zod
In the `Python` version of `Langchain` `Pydantic` can be used to define schemas but in the `LangChain.JS` version `Zod` is used for the same purpose.
We need to install 'zod' as a third party package.
```
npm install zod
```
We will also need the package 'zod-to-json-schema':
```
npm install zod-to-json-schema
````
